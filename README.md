# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
I will be considering the google stocks data and will create a LSTM network for prediction.
Here we have two file train and test, having its google share prices with open, high, low , close values for a particular day. Using this data in our LSTM model we will predict the open prices for next 20 days.

I will also be explaining the parameter tuning for model using keras Wrappers and Randomized Search SV.
